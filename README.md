# Political-bias-detection-in-Articles-using-Roberta-large
To detect Political bias in News articles I have fine tuned the Roberta large model to give bias(left, right , center) rating to new input articles.
The Dataset is webscaped by me, didnot use any source.(used GDELT, Ground News for data scraping)
